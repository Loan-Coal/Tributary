## B. Graph store (Neo4j)

| Capability | Status |
|-----------|--------|

| Ownership edges `[:OWNS {pct}]` | 🟡 seed writes |
| Account, Transaction, Counterparty, Jurisdiction nodes | 🟡 seed writes |
| Relationship edges (HOLDS, RECORDS, WITH, RESIDENT_IN, BASED_IN) | 🟡 seed writes |
| Related-party detection (common ownership within N hops) | ⬜ Wave 2 |
| Fund-flow tracing across the graph | ⬜ Wave 2 |
| Derived `[:HAS_OBLIGATION]` edge (written by engine) | 🟡 `GraphWriter` protocol defined; Neo4j implementation is Wave 2 |
